## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r pressure 2, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
plot(pressure)
```


## Insert Tables
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
  caption = "Top 6 Rows of Cars Dataset")
```


## Insert an equation

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$
